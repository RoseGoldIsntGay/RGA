#### Explanation of Custom Item Macros:
	
Usage: `/usecooldown [milliseconds] [left]`

- Will create a new custom macro for the currently held item

- Use `/usecooldown 7000` to set a custom macro for Wand of Atonement

- Use `/usecooldown 100 left` to set a custom macro for Terminator

#### Explanation of Foraging Island Macro:

- Macro was made for [this method of foraging](https://youtu.be/ZPdeElnhB08) 

- Make sure the only 4 dirt blocks in range of the player are the ones to plant the tree on

- Make sure the tree can grow naturally:
	-  There is enough air above the dirt to let the tree grow
	- There are no solid blocks surrounding the tree

- Need to have in hotbar:
	- Treecapitator
	- Jungle / Dark Oak / Spruce Saplings
	- Enchanted Bonemeal
	- Fishing Rod
- Autopet rules: 
	- `When: You throw a fishing hook` -> `Equip Monkey`
	- `When: You gain Foraging XP` -> `Equip Ocelot`

- You can set up a redstone clock hooked up to a dropper system to allow for full automation

#### More info about Ghost Macro:
- A custom macro can be set to automatically use Soul Whip to shoot  at the closest ghost
- A custom macro can be set to automatically use healing items to stay alive
- It is also possible to use a different mod, such as [Oringo Client](https://shadyaddons.com/other-mods)'s Kill Aura to automatically kill ghosts in combination with custom macros
